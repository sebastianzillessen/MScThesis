  abstract = {This guide describes how to apply use cases in an agile and scalable fashion. It builds on the current state of the art to present an evolution of the use-case technique that we call Use-Case 2.0. The goal is to provide you with a foundation to help you get the most out of your use cases; one that is not only applicable for small colocated agile teams but also large distributed teams, outsourcing, and complex multi-system developments.
It presents the essentials of use-case driven development as an accessible and re-usable practice. It also provides an introduction to the idea of use cases and their application. It is deliberately kept lightweight. It is not a comprehensive guide to all aspects of use cases, or a tutorial on use-case modeling. It may not be sufficient 
for you to adopt the practice. For example, it is not intended to teach you how to model, for this we refer you to our previously published books on the subject.},
