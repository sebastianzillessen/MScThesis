\section{Background research}

Understanding human argumentation has proven as important topic regarding recent developments in \Gls{AI} and Agent-based systems. Applications such as belief revision, decision-making, inter-agent communication, medical reasoning, semantic web reasoning and trust computing rely on the ability to deal with uncertainty, incompletness and inconsistency of information \cite{liao,Bench2007}.

Non-monotonic argumentation (as proposed in \cite{dung1995, liao}) and monotonic (classical) logic \cite{Reiter1980} are different approaches to deal with reasoning for that kind of applications. Recent research is focusing on dialogue based approaches which are mostly based on non-monotonic argumentation, as this is an emerging topic in the world of agents and multi-agent systems \cite{parsons2000,Walton1995}.

In this background research a general overview over an argumentation frameworks definition will be given. Furthermore this will be extended to reason about preferences in argumentation frameworks \cite{Modgil2009}. In addition a summary based on \cite{sassoon2014} of the problem of selecting statistical models by clinicians will be given. Finally a short overview on related work will be presented.

%Fundamental mechanism, humans use in argumentation, and exploring ways to implement this mechanism on computers. 
\begin{itemize}
	%\item developing a theory for argumentation (central notion is the acceptability of arguments) \cite{dung1995}, \cite{Modgil2009}
	\item \todo{correctness of this theory ( most approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of this theory of argumentation)}
\end{itemize}


??? Other approaches to non-monotonic reasoning in \Gls{AI} and logic programming are specialised forms of this theory of argumentation.???


\subsection{Argumentation Theory - Working with Preferences in $AF$}

Based on Isabel's second paper\cite{sassoon2016}, based on Extended Argumentation Framework\cite{Modgil2009}, using preferences as arguments for attacks on the attack-relation in the original argumentation.
Distinguishing to Amgouds's\cite{amgoud}  Preference based Argumentation Framework.

\subsection{Source paper}
Short summary of Isabels paper \cite{sassoon2014}. Focus on argumentation theory behind it and model selection process. Preferences expressed as attacks on the attacks between the arguments for models.

\subsection{Related work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Argumentation for Aggregating Clinical Evidence \cite{hunter}: multiple outcome indicators, checks only old date, not supposed data for recommendation, focuses on generation of arguments out of evidence
	\item An argument-based approach to reasoning with clinical knowledge\cite{Gorogiannis20091}: Focus on simple language representing the results of clinical trials, doesn't deal with preferences of different priorities.

	\item In Argumentation for Decision Support\cite{Atkinson2006} an approach using values in the $AF$ is presented, where $A2$ defeats $A1$ iff $A2$ attacks $A1$ and $val(A2) \ngtr_a val(A1)$ which is not applicable as no strict partial order given.
\end{itemize}


\section{Design process - Use Cases}
Taken from Ivar Jacobson, see \autoref{fig:usecase20:flow}.\insertref{UseCase2.0}
\begin{itemize}
	\item popular MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Would) prioritization scheme
	\item Use Case on one card (Priority, Release, Size, Complexity)
	\item Use Case Slices generated from use case (Flows, Tests, Estimation)
	\item Find Actors and Use Cases (slice them subsequently)
	\item Prepare Use Case Slices by describing related stories (use-case narrative) and defining test cases
	\item Analyse Use Case Slices (check how the system elements will interact to perform the use case)
	\item Implement Use Case Slice
	\item Test Use Case Slice
	\item Inspect and Adapt
	\item Test System
\end{itemize}

\section{Involved Data}
\subsection{Actual data}
The data makes use of a small data set used to illustrate the use of survival analysis methodologies when teaching the subject. The data set is called ovarian and contains the survival in a randomised trial comparing two treatments for ovarian cancer. This has 26 cases and the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item futime: survival\footnote{Survival in days while not observing the event} or censoring time\footnote{Patient left the observation after this amount of time and the event didnt take place}\item fustat: censoring status (1: survival, 0: censored\todo{Is this like this?})\item age: of the patient in years\item resid.ds: residual disease present (1=no,2=yes) 
\item rx: treatment group (integers)
\item ecog.ps: ECOG performance status (see \autoref{tab:ecog})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Knowledge Base}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Models are suitable for research questions
	\item models have critical assumptions
	\item Models have non-critical assumptions (might be violated and can still be alright to use
	\item \texttt{m2 must fulfil the following critical assumptions ["a1", "a2"], ... }\insertref{Isabels follow up paper of example and data and models}
	\item \texttt{ Survival can be achieved by using the following model \{"m1"=>"a1", "m2"=>["a1", "a2"], "m3" =>["a1", "a3"]\}}
	\item Assumptions met given ($a_i$). Then we use AS1 ($m_i$ is a possible model if 
			\footnote{
				- Model $m_i$ achieves objective $o_c$\\				- The data set meets the set of assumptions $A_t' = A_t (m_i)$\\				- The research project meets the set of assumptions $A'_q = A_q (m_i)$\\				- $A_c(m_i) \subseteq A_t' \cup A_q'$\\
				- $A_t$: Tests are assumptions that are assessed by applying a test on the available data set \\
				- $A_q$: queries are assumptions that are assessed by asking the clinician for an opinion.
			})
	\item R-Code (execution in Ruby possible \cite{rinRuby}  \insertref{https://github.com/clbustos/rinruby} \footnote{\texttt{rinruby} is a gem, that enables evaluation of R code in ruby}) and required outcomes for it decide, whether this model $m_i$ is possible or not. 
	\item In Argumentation for Decision Support\cite{Atkinson2006} an approach using values in the AF is presented, where $A2$ defeats $A1$ iff $A2$ attacks $A1$ and $val(A2) \ngtr_a val(A1)$ which is not applicable as no strict partial order given.
