\section{Background Research}

\todo{The first three paragraphs lacks coherence because it lists a range of generic and specific issues.  You should instead simple state what the background research will cover and establish why this is to be reviewed in the context of your project.  You probably want to explain that Isabel's work is based on computational models of argumentation and why this is so.}

%Understanding human argumentation has proven as an important topic regarding recent development in \gls{AI} and agent-based systems. Applications such as belief revision, decision-making, inter-agent communication, medical reasoning, semantic web reasoning and trust computing rely on the ability to deal with uncertainty, incompletness and inconsistency of information \cite{liao,Bench2007}.


Non-monotonic argumentation (as proposed in \cite{liao,dung1995}) and monotonic (classic) logic (as proposed in \cite{Reiter1980}) are different approaches to deal with reasoning for that kind of applications. Recent research is focusing on dialogue based approaches which are mostly based on non-monotonic argumentation, as this is an emerging topic in the world of agents and multi-agent systems \cite{parsons2000,Walton1995}.

In this background research a general overview on argumentation frameworks will be given. Furthermore an extension to reason about preferences will be presented. In addition a summary of Sassoon \textit{et al.} \cite{sassoon2014} on the problem of finding applicable and choosing preferred models by clinicians for a given research question is presented. This is followed by a short overview on related work.
