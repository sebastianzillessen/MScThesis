\section{Background research}

Understanding human argumentation has proven as an important topic regarding recent development in \Gls{AI} and Agent-based systems. Applications such as belief revision, decision-making, inter-agent communication, medical reasoning, semantic web reasoning and trust computing rely on the ability to deal with uncertainty, incompletness and inconsistency of information \cite{liao,Bench2007}.

Non-monotonic argumentation (as proposed in \cite{liao,dung1995}) and monotonic (classic) logic (as proposed in \cite{Reiter1980}) are different approaches to deal with reasoning for that kind of applications. Recent research is focusing on dialogue based approaches which are mostly based on non-monotonic argumentation, as this is an emerging topic in the world of agents and multi-agent systems \cite{parsons2000,Walton1995}.

In this background research a general overview on argumentation frameworks will be given. Furthermore an extension to reason about preferences will be presented. In addition a summary of Sassoon \textit{et al.} \cite{sassoon2014} on the problem of finding applicable and choosing preferred models by clinicians for a given research question is presented. This is followed by a short overview on related work.

	\subsection{Related work regarding clinical data analysis}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Argumentation for Aggregating Clinical Evidence \cite{hunter}: multiple outcome indicators, checks only old date, not supposed data for recommendation, focuses on generation of arguments out of evidence
		\item An argument-based approach to reasoning with clinical knowledge\cite{Gorogiannis20091}: Focus on simple language representing the results of clinical trials, doesn't deal with preferences of different priorities.

		\item \cite{Atkinson2006} an approach based on \gls{VAF}.
