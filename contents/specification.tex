\section{Specification}
\label{sec:specification}

In accordance with the selected methodology of Use Case 2.0 (see \autoref{sec:design}) no in-depth specification has been written, however a reasonable amount of \glspl{use_case} has been defined and iterativly refined. These were then reviewed by the client and discussed in detail. All \glspl{use_case} have been described on cards on Trello and \glspl{use_case_slice} have been generated out of those. They are directly reflected by the description in \cite{sassoon2016,sassoon2014, sassoon2016CD}. In general each \gls{use_case} consists of the following attributes: Name, Desired outcome, (Main-)\Glspl{Actor}, Flow to achieve the desired outcome, and Alternative flow (optional).


\subsection{Weak Requirements}
\label{sub:weak}
In addition to the described \glspl{use_case} in \autoref{tab:usecases} (derived from \autoref{sub:aims}), the following weak requirements influenced the development of the final project:


\begin{itemize}
	\item The system should be designed as an interactive \textbf{web application} to ensure:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Access for multiple users.
		\item Portability between different operating systems.
		\item No requirement of installation of software on local computers.
		\item Clinician and statistician can share the same infrastructure without the need of working at the same place.
	\end{itemize}
	\item A decent test suite should be provided to ensure the functionality of the system.
	\item The system must be suitable for different user types (\glspl{Actor}).
	\item The system has to provide different levels of access for different user groups.
	\item The system has to execute test scripts as \gls{R}-Scripts.
	\item The system should be hosted on a free accessible hosting provider.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Actors in our System}
\label{sub:sassoon:actors}
During the requirements analysis the following actors have been identified and are described as follows:

\textbf{Clinicians} are the main users of the system and do the actual analysis of a data set by using the predefined research questions, models and assumptions. A clinician should see all globally available research questions, models and their assumptions. In addition the preferences defined by the statistician will apply to all analyses a clinician performs. However they will be able to enter personal preferences between models that only apply for their analyses. An overview over those uses cases can be seen in \autoref{fig:usecase:clinician}.

\textbf{Statisticians} are able to enter statistical models into the system and to define global applicable preferences. To do so, a statistician can enter different types of assumptions mapped to models and preferences. These might contain query assumptions, where the clinician performing an analysis has to confirm a fact, or test assumptions that are checked against the data set by running an \texttt{R}-script. A statistician is as well allowed to see all data sets that have been uploaded and to check which analysis have been performed (see \autoref{fig:usecase:statistician}).



\textbf{Administrators} are able to create, modify and delete all available data in the system. In addition an administrator is required to approve new users and to assign them to a role. They are as well capable of inviting new users into the system. An overview over their uses cases can be seen in \autoref{fig:usecase:admin}.





\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{sub:use_cases}
\autoref{tab:usecases} shows an overview over the major \glspl{use_case} being generated during the requirements analysis. For the sake of simplicity they have not been integrated into this thesis. However they are available on the \href{https://trello.com/b/ywCkicpc}{Trello-Board}\footnote{\url{https://trello.com/b/ywCkicpc}}.

The \glspl{use_case} defined in \autoref{tab:usecases} were then further defined, deriving requirements have been generated as \glspl{use_case_slice} and were implemented by applying an iterative approach. Close feedback loops to the author of \cite{sassoon2016,sassoon2014,sassoon2016CD} (\gls{product owner} or client) ensured the correctness of these implementations. As the software was developed in a test driven approach (see \autoref{sec:tdd}), all features were implemented by designing tests first. This is reflected by the final test suite (see \autoref{sub:test_suit}) which contains a decent amount of \glspl{unit_test}, \glspl{integration_test} and \glspl{e2e_test} and has an overall test coverage of $ \geq 85\%$\footnote{\url{https://codeclimate.com/github/sebastianzillessen/small-data-analyst/coverage}}. \autoref{uc:12-1} shows an exemplary, detailed description of one \gls{use_case}.

\subsection{Technical Specification}
\label{sub:technical}

As the system should be accessible by multiple users and from different departments (e.g. clinicians and statisticians), it will be developed as a web-application in \gls{RoR}\footnote{\url{http://rubyonrails.org}} and will be hosted on Heroku\footnote{\url{https://www.heroku.com}} as this will provide an easy-to-use and easy-to-deploy environment. In addition it allows us to host the demo application for free. To provide a \gls{CI} environment, the project code is hosted on \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sebastianzillessen/small-data-analyst}} and a \texttt{Travis CI}\footnote{\url{https://travis-ci.org/sebastianzillessen/small-data-analyst}} instance has been setup that runs all the implemented tests of the project.

The used data sets are anonymised, so data protection issues are reduced to a minimum and the data sets can be hosted in the cloud. \texttt{PostgreSQL}\footnote{\url{http://www.postgresql.org}} will be used as a database, as it is well integrated on Heroku and provides high scalability. Generated plots are stored in an Amazon Web Services S3 Storage\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/s3}, a simple storage service.}.

The assumption tests for the statistical models will be performed in \gls{R}, as this is a common used language for statistical calculations and well known by statisticians. In addition many assumption-checks already exist in \gls{R}. These scripts (externally provided) will be executed in the \gls{RoR} application with the help of third party gems. A detailed description of this process can be found in \autoref{sec:r_code}.

To provide a responsive and clear user interface the \texttt{Bootstrap}\footnote{\url{http://getbootstrap.com}} framework will be used to design and style the application. 

\subsection{Data Flow in the System}


\autoref{fig:data_flow} shows the simplified data flows in the process of statistical model selection: First of all, the statistician has to create research questions (1) including their possible models (2) and the required assumptions (3) and global preferences (4). These are all stored in a knowledge base which is itself stored in  a persistent database. A detailed description of all database classes can be found in \autoref{sub:db}. 

\begin{figure}[btph]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/data_flow}
	\caption{Core data flow in the system to create new analyses.}
	\label{fig:data_flow}
\end{figure}


A clinician can upload new clinical data retrieved from studies by using the CSV upload functionality (6). Starting a new analysis (7) retrieves the data set from the database and instantiates the knowledge base for this specific problem. The assumptions of all applicable models for the selected research question are then evaluated. If multiple models are possible, the preferences (first the globally defined ones by a statistician, later the personal preferences (5) a clinician might have) are applied in order of there importance until one last model remains. This model is then returned as recommended model. The process of the rejection of various models will be graphically visible to the user (see \autoref{sub:ui}). The process of creating and processing a new analysis is described in detail in \autoref{sub:walk}.
