\section{Specification}
\label{sec:specification}
\todo{Little bit more specifying the format of inputs and outpust, this should be addressed in a more detailed specification chapter in the eventual report}

In accordance with the selected methodology of Use Cases 2.0 (see \autoref{sec:design}) no in-depth specification has been written, however a reasonable amount of Use Cases have been defined and refined. These were then reviewed by the client and discussed in detail. As mentioned, the project used Trello as managment tool. All Use Cases have been described on cards over there and subtasks have been generated out of these Use Cases. In the following section an exemplary description of the different Use Cases and therby the requirements of the software are presented. They are directy reflected by the description in \cite{sassoon2014,sassoon2106, sassoon2016CD}. The

Each Use Case consists of the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Name
\item Desired outcome
\item Actors
\item Steps to achieve the desired outcome
\item Alternative steps (optional)
\end{itemize}
