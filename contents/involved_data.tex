\section{Involved Data}
\subsection{Actual Data}
The data makes use of a small data set used to illustrate the use of survival analysis methodologies when teaching the subject. The data set is called ovarian and contains the survival in a randomised trial comparing two treatments for ovarian cancer. This has 26 cases and the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item futime: survival\footnote{Survival in days while not observing the event} or censoring time\footnote{Patient left the observation after this amount of time and the event didnt take place}\item fustat: censoring status \footnote{"1" indicates that the event has been observed at time $futime$, "0" that the event has not been observed until $futime$}\item age: of the patient in years\item resid.ds: residual disease present (1=no, 2=yes) 
\item rx: treatment group (integers)
\item ecog.ps: ECOG performance status (see \autoref{tab:ecog})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Knowledge Base}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Models are suitable for research questions
	\item models have critical assumptions
	\item Models have non-critical assumptions (might be violated and can still be alright to use
	\item \texttt{m2 must fulfil the following critical assumptions ["a1", "a2"], ... }\insertref{Isabels follow up paper of example and data and models}
	\item Survival can be achieved by using the following model \texttt{\{"m1"=>"a1", "m2"=>["a1", "a2"], "m3" =>["a1", "a3"]\}}
	\item Assumptions met given ($a_i$). Then we use AS1 (see \autoref{as:1})
	\item R-Code (execution in Ruby possible \cite{rinRuby}  \insertref{https://github.com/clbustos/rinruby} \footnote{\texttt{rinruby} is a gem, that enables evaluation of R code in ruby}) and required outcomes for it decide, whether this model $m_i$ is possible or not. 
	\item In Argumentation for Decision Support\cite{Atkinson2006} an approach using values in the AF is presented, where $A2$ defeats $A1$ iff $A2$ attacks $A1$ and $val(A2) \ngtr_a val(A1)$ which is not applicable as no strict partial order given.
\end{itemize}
