\section*{Abstract}

Data collection has seen a dramatic increase over the last years and researcher agree exploiting these to create data driven decision processes is crucial to generate valuable insights for clinical studies. This generates the requirement to assist clinicians during the design process of their studies with an intelligent support agent performing these analyses for them. 

This project looks at an existing approach to apply argumentation on this problem, by representing the statistical models and their assumptions as a statistical knowledge base and implementing the process into an user-friendly web application. The model selection process is influenced by expressing preferences applying on different context domains and the close integration of the clinician and insights she/he can give related to the process. This will enable clinicians -- even without a background in statistics or informatics -- to answer their research questions in an appropriated way and to make evidence based decisions.
