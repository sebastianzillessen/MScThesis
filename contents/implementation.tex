\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
\todo{The technical contribution of the project, including experimental and/or theoretical results.}

\todo{Program listings (depending on the project nature). Complete source code listings must be submitted as an appendix to the report (excluding any well-known, freely obtainable, third-party libraries explicitly mentioned in the report). In addition, the source code must be submitted in a compressed file via KEATS together with the report. You should try to help the reader to navigate through your source code by providing a "table of contents" (titles of these files/units and one line descriptions). The first page of the program listings folder must contain the following statement certifying the work as your own: "I verify that I am the sole author of the programs contained in this folder, except where explicitly stated to the contrary". Your (typed) signature and the date should follow this statement.}
