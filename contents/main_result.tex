\section{Application Overview}
\label{sec:app}
In the following chapter a short introduction to the actual system will be given. An entity relationship diagram explains the core data foundation of this project in \autoref{sub:db}, which includes the representation of the \gls{SKB} as described in \autoref{sub:SKB}. The general process, core functionalities and the \gls{UI} will be presented in \autoref{sub:process}-\ref{sub:ui}. This is followed by a typical walkthrough to create a new analysis as a clinician. 

The application is available on \href{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com}{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com} and the explained steps can be reproduced in the demo application. At the end of this chapter a short discussion on observations is included, providing as well the insight feedback of an actual statistician using the software. A detailed view on some key components of the software can be found in \autoref{sec:implementation}.


To test the application the standard \textit{ovarian}-dataset available in \texttt{R} has been used. In addition to that, I. Sassoon provided an anonymised version of a larger clinical data set (see \autoref{app:dataset}). The description of the dataset can be found in \autoref{fig:dataset}. Possible research question arising from this dataset are presented in \autoref{fig:dataset:rq}.
