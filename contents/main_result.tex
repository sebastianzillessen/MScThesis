\section{Application Overview}
\label{sec:app}
In the following chapter a short introduction to the actual system will be given. The general process, core functionalities and the \gls{UI} will be presented in \cref{sub:process,sub:ui}. This is followed by a typical walkthrough to create a new analysis as a clinician. 

The application is available on \href{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com}{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com} and the explained steps can be reproduced in the demo application. A detailed view on some key components of the software can be found in \autoref{sec:implementation}. To test the application the standard \textit{ovarian} data set available in \texttt{R} has been used. In addition to that, I. Sassoon provided an anonymised version of a larger clinical data set (see \autoref{app:dataset}). The description of the data set can be found in \autoref{fig:dataset}. Possible research question arising from this data set are presented in \autoref{fig:dataset:rq}. The hosted application contains some of the provided research questions, their models and the required assumptions in its \gls{SKB}.
