\section{Application Overview}
In the following chapter a short introduction to the actual system will be given. The general process and the user interface will be presented in \autoref{sub:process}-\ref{sub:ui} and the key areas will be explained. Furthermore an introduction to the underlying database models will be given, which includes the representation of the \gls{SKB} as described in \autoref{sub:SKB}. This is followed by a typical walkthrough to create a new analysis as a clinician. As stated before, the application is available on \href{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com}{https://small-data-analyst.herokuapp.com} and these steps can be reproduced in the demo application. At the end of this chapter a short discussion on observations is included, providing as well the insight feedback of an actual statistician using the software. A detailed view on some key components of the software can be found in \autoref{sec:implementation}.

\subsection{General Process}
\label{sub:process}
The crucial role in the process of enabling clinicians to analyse there clinical data is played by the statistician: registered or approved by an administrator he is allowed to perform significant changes to the \gls{SKB} which is required to provide the clinician with a sophisticated foundation for his analyses. 

To do so a statistician will first prepare the system involving the following steps:


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Defining a research question (see \autoref{fig:ui:rq}).
	\item Assigning suitable models (see \autoref{fig:ui:model}) to a research question and providing assumptions (see \autoref{fig:ui:assumption}) that need to hold to make this model a possible model in a particular analysis.
	\item Defining (global) preferences to express a particular order between models in certain contexts that apply if a certain assumption holds (see \autoref{fig:ui:preference}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ui_RQ}
\caption{Listing of research questions: The highlighted areas might not be available, depending on your access rights.}
\label{fig:ui:rq}
\end{figure}


A clinician can then perform a new analysis by performing the steps below:
 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Uploading a dataset that has been acquired during a clinical study.
	\item Optionally expressing (private) preferences between different models.
	\item Generating a new analysis and providing the answers required by the system to generate a list of possible models.
	\item Answering further data related questions that might arise during the evaluation of the possible models to apply context domain specific preferences on the dataset.
\end{enumerate}

By applying these steps, clinicians will be able to make data-driven decisions that are based on the expertise entered by a statistician.

\subsection{User Interface}
\label{sub:ui}
The \gls{UI} is intentionally kept clean for simplicity reasons: \texttt{Bootstrap} is used to provide a consistent look \& feel and responsiveness of the application. As described in \autoref{sub:sassoon:actors} we have three main users in our system which have different abilities\footnote{Abilities are access rights, that are specified via an \texttt{Ability} class that is used by \texttt{cancancan} to provide diversified access-rights to different user groups in our system.} influencing the appearance of the \gls{UI} (eg. a clinician will not be able to create, alter or delete any research questions, however he will still be able to see them as depicted in \autoref{fig:ui:rq}). This approach allows us to use the same \gls{UI}-components for different users without writing them once again (\gls{DRY} principle).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ui_Weibull_Model}
\caption{Overview over a model, in this particular case the \textit{Weibull model} which requires two assumptions to hold.}
\label{fig:ui:model}
\end{figure}

To provide easier access to the underlying \gls{SKB}, research questions and models include a visual representation of their relations as a graph (see lower right part of\autoref{fig:ui:model}). The system offers four different types of assumptions which have special functionalities (see \autoref{fig:ui:assumption}):

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ui_new_assumption}
\caption{The system provides four different types of assumptions: Test, Query, Test-Query, and Blank assumptions.}
\label{fig:ui:assumption}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{TestAssumption}: An assumption that requires a \texttt{R} script to be executed and to return \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}. These assumptions will be checked automatically from the system and rely only on the dataset used in an analysis.
	\item \texttt{QueryAssumption}: A clinician has to provide a \textit{yes} or \textit{no} answer to a question during the process of the analysis. Only if he answers positively, this assumption holds.
	\item \texttt{QueryTestAssumption}: A \texttt{R} script generates a plot based on the dataset, which is then presented to the user who has to confirm that the plot shows some required features.
	\item \texttt{BlankAssumption}: An assumption that represents a grouping ability for other assumptions. It holds only if all of it assigned assumptions (regardless of their type) hold. 
\end{itemize}

Each of those require different attributes which results in different forms during the creation process of new assumptions. 

The most complex component from a \gls{UI} perspective are preferences, as they involve context domains and there required assumptions and relative orders per context domain. \autoref{fig:ui:preference} shows how this has been solved: (1) allows the user to enter general details for a preference (availability to users, rank of the preference and a name). For each context domain that is available for this particular preference (multiple can be added), an assumption (2) has to be chosen. A context domain will be applied, if and only if this assumption holds. The relatively order between models can be specified easily via drag \& drop (3). This order will be taken into account when analysing the \gls{EAF} at the final step of the analysis process.

\subsection{Database models}

\subsection{Example walkthrough}
\label{sub:walk}

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ui_analysis_0}
\caption{Creating a new analysis, step 1: Selection of dataset and research question. }
\label{fig:analysis:1}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ui_analysis_1}
\caption{Creating a new analysis, step 2: Clinician has to answer \texttt{QueryTest-} and \texttt{QueryAssumptions} to perform the analysis. \texttt{TestAssumptions} have already been evaluated.}
\label{fig:analysis:2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ui_analysis_2_no}
\caption{Creating a new analysis, step 3: After answering one question (e.g. "Has no non-informative censoring been in place?" with \textit{No}), the possible models are updated and outdated \texttt{QueryAssumptions} might be removed from the list of queries.}
\label{fig:analysis:3_no}
\end{figure}

The picture \autoref{fig:analysis:eaf} shows an analysis performed involving the dataset XXX\todo{describe dataset} and a survival analysis by gender, where the preferences have been set according to \cite{sassoon2016CD}. All \texttt{QueryAssumptions} have been answered positively, so after the initial initialisation of the argumentation framework all three models remain possible. During the evaluation of the preferences per context domain \textit{Kaplan-Meier} and \textit{Weibull} models are wiped-out as "\textit{Censoring}" has the performance measurement \textbf{heavy}. The generated \gls{EAF} on the right side of \autoref{fig:analysis:eaf} shows the reason why only \textit{Cox-Proportional hazard} remains as the last preferred model.
