\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\todo{Evaluation distinct from testing}
\todo{ It is a chapter to sum up the main points of the work, such as the aims and objectives of the project, the contributions and results you have achieved.  Future plan and development can be mentioned in this section.}
 
 \todo{Conclusions, including an overview of what has actually been achieved by the project, an interpretation of the results, and suggestions of how the project could be further extended.}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item no gem
 	\item analyses works great
 	\item graphical representation of argumentation framework
 	\item outlook: making provenance of data possible (\todo{look for resource}) to map data attributes for analyses to different RQ (e.g. is there a difference in survival timer according to gender / age) by allowing dynamically rscripts (regarding attributes) and injection of argument mapping into an existing analysis.
 	\item 
 \end{itemize}

\\$\square${Captions must be provided for all figures and tables.}
\\$\square${Equations (or important equations), figures and tables must be numbered.}
\\$\square${All figures and tables must be referred to in the text.}
\\$\square${Units of all variables must be provided.}
\\$\square${Numercial values (floating-point number) should be in 4 decimal places.}
\\$\square${Contractions should not be used.}
\\$\square${Check punctuation of sentences.  In particular, those sentences with equation.  For example, if an equation is at the end of a sentence, a full stop should be used.}
\\$\square${All variables must be defined.}
\\$\square${Font face of variables throughout the report (in the text, equation, figures and table) must be consistent.}
\\$\square${Use proper headings for chapters, sections, subsections.}
\\$\square${Chapters, sections, subsections should be numbered and with the same numbering system throughout the report.}
\\$\square${It is suggested that vector and matrix variables should be in bold, scalar variables should be in italic.}
